# VernamCryptLab
Here's developing program for complete information security lab. Current lab performs crypting by the Vernam crypt var. It could be completed by the same programming language or framework.
I choose the TKinter for create a UI. 

## Instructions:

  1) Before start:
    
    - Create key, key MUST BE CONTAINED ONLY latin alphas!
    - Create message. Program performs only latin alphas, spaces and special characters would be ingnored!
  2) Start the program;
  3) SELECT your own:
    
    - If you want to crypt message, select the "Crypt" option.
    - Else you may stay without selecting, but if you chosen same time ago previous option, now you should select "Encrypt".
  4) Press button "Select key" to select key file;
  5) Press button "Select message" to select message file;
  6) Press button "Complite" to complete performing and save crypted or encrypted message to new file, add ".txt" on the end of the filename if you need (it's easy to read at all);
